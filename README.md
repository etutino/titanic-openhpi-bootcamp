# titanic-openhpi-bootcamp
My final project for the openHPI Data Science Bootcamp to build two ML models using the Titanic dataset.

I performed EDA and data cleaning of the Titanic dataset. I then built two ML models (logistic regression model and decision tree model) and calculated the accuracy of both models.
